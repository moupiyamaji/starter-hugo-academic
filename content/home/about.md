I am an astrophysicist and astronomy education researcher with a multidisciplinary background that
bridges fundamental astrophysical research and science education. My academic trajectory spans com-
putational studies of the early universe, galaxy evolution, and stellar physics, as well as empirical
research in science pedagogy, including a nationwide survey assessing astronomy knowledge and atti-
tudes among school students in India. I am strongly committed to advancing evidence-based teaching
practices and have led multiple teacher training workshops and mentoring initiatives. My work is
grounded in a broader vision of inclusive and effective science education, and I remain actively engaged
in public outreach and science communication to promote scientific literacy.
