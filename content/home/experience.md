**IAU - Office of Astronomy for Education (OAE) Center India** - **Postdoctoral Research**  2022 - now
* Designed and led a nationwide, multilingual survey study on the status of astronomy education
among 2000 secondary school students across 11 Indian states.
* Developed the 16-item instrument addressing conceptual understanding, curriculum alignment, cul-
tural relevance, resource exposure, and student aspirations regarding astronomy.
* Led the data analysis process â€” developed coding schemes, supervised digitization, and conducted
statistical analysis to identify learning gaps and systemic inequities.
* Findings revealed widespread conceptual gaps, limited access to resources, lack of career guidance,
and notable disparities along socioeconomic backgrounds, despite high student interest in astronomy.
* Developed and administered a complementary 10-question teacher survey, conducting interviews to
capture educator perspectives and actionable recommendations.
* Research outcomes contribute to curriculum development, equity-centered interventions, and targeted
teacher training programs.

**Universite de Geneve** - **PostDoctoral Research**     2018 - 2021

* Simulated the radiative transfer of lyman alpha photons from thousands of galaxies in the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation SPHINX using 3D RT code RASCAS, analyzed the datasets consisting physical and radiative properties of the galaxies and investigated the correlations between their ionizing radiation and other observable properties and predicted that bright lyman alpha emitting galaxies are the primary sources of reionization.
* Built predictive statistical models using multivariate linear regression and showed that it is possible to predict the contribution of a galaxy towards reionization with a high degree of accuracy given their observable physical properties and Lyman alpha emission; such models can be very useful for planning future observing missions.

**The Pennsylvania State University - Ph.D. Research**     2012 - 2018

* Systematically explored observed Milky Way satellite data to understand the eect of undersampling on the anisotropy and kinematic coherence of satellite planes. Compared a baryonic and N-body simulation to demonstrate that hydrodynamical simulations can reproduce anisotropic satellite distributions.
* Studied the origin of the universal log-normal mass function in globular clusters by performing major galaxy merger simulations and explored the formation of massive star clusters in them that showed extreme high pressure clouds in highly shocked regions of mergers can produce massive star clusters with lognormal mass function which may evolve into globular clusters observed today.

**Indian Institute of Science - Masters thesis**       2011 - 2012

* Developed theoretical models to determine the pattern speed of warped spiral galaxies and extract the 3D velocity eld of a spiral galaxy given observations of its surface brightness and the line-of-sight velocities and tested it successfully on a numerically simulated galaxy.

**Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics - Undergraduate Research Associate**  2009

* Analyzed data collected at the ALICE detector of the Large Hadron Collider in spring of 2009, calculated the electronic stability of MANAS chips used in the detector and found that there was no deformation in the data and the noise level is less than half of the accepted threshold.
