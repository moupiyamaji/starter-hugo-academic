I am an astrophysicist and astronomy education researcher with a multidisciplinary background that
bridges fundamental astrophysical research and science education. 

My academic trajectory spans computational studies of the early universe, galaxy evolution, and stellar physics, as well as empirical
research in science pedagogy, including a nationwide survey assessing astronomy knowledge and attitudes among school students in India. I am strongly committed to advancing evidence-based teaching practices and have led multiple teacher training workshops and mentoring initiatives. 

My work is grounded in a broader vision of inclusive and effective science education, and I remain actively engaged
in public outreach and science communication to promote scientific literacy.
